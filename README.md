# Carney Lab Timeline (Gantt chart)
Python code for making the Carney Lab personnel gantt chart.
We were inspired by https://github.com/HillLabSask/HillLab_gantt_chart/ 
from Prof. Janet E. Hill (@HillLabSask)

Updated periodically and posted on the lab webpage https://research-groups.usask.ca/hilllab/people.php
